# Lab 31 Synth Tracker

## Overview

This is a synth tracker app. A new synth can be created with the form on the home page. This will add a new synth to the list of synths. The synth will have an update form attached which allows a user to update that synth. There will also be a delete button to delete this synth synthCompany. Each synth synthCompany can have synths added. Within each synthCompany will be a form where one can add synths. Also within the synthCompany will be a list of synths, each of which can be updated or deleted. To edit any section, double-click on that section, and a form to update the text or amount will appear.
